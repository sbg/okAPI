    "# How to setup Seven Bridges Public API python library\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Here you will learn the three possible ways to setup Seven Bridges Public API Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to install _sevenbridges-python_ library. Library details are available [here](http://sevenbridges-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sevenbridges/)\n",
    "\n",
    "    The easiest way to install sevenbridges-python is using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "       $ pip install sevenbridges-python\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternatively, you can get the code. sevenbridges-python is actively developed on GitHub, where the [code](https://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-python) is always available. To clone the public repository :\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ git clone git://github.com/sbg/sevenbridges-python.git\n",
    "\n",
    "    Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python\n",
    "    package, or install it into your site-packages by invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "        $ python setup.py install\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You need your _authentication token_ which you can get [here](https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/account#developer)\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Notes and Compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Python package is intended to be used with both Python 2.7+ and Python 3.x versions. \n",
    "Following packages are necessary requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Requests package, used to make HTTP requests easily\n",
    "2. Six package, providing compatibility for Python versions 2.x and 3.x\n",
    "3. Enum34 backport package for providing enum on Python versions < 3.4"

    "### Initialize the library\n",
    "\n",
    "You can initialize the library explicitly or by supplying the necessary information in the .sbgrc file\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally three ways to initialize the library:\n",
    " 1. Explicitly, when calling api constructor, like:\n",
    "   ``` python\n",
    "   api = sbg.Api(url='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2', token='MY AUTH TOKEN')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "  \n",
    " 2. By using OS environment to store the url and authentication token\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "      export AUTH_TOKEN=<MY AUTH TOKEN>\n",
    "      export API_ENDPOINT='https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    " 3. By using ini file $HOME/.sevenbridges/credentials (for MS Windows, the file should be located in \\%UserProfile\\%.sevenbridges\\credentials) and specifying a profile to use. The format of the .sbgrc is standard ini file format, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "    [sbpla]\n",
    "    api_endpoint = https://api.sbgenomics.com/v2\n",

    "       cd ~\n",
    "       mkdir .sevenbridges\n",

    "       vi .sevenbridges/credentials\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "    2. Press \"i\" then enter to go into **insert mode**\n",
    "    3. write the text above for each environment. \n",
