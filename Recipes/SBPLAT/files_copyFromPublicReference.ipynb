    "# How do I _copy_ a file from the _Public Reference_ files?\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Files can be copied from other projects you are a member of or from the public reference files page. Here we focus on copying a file from _public reference files_ page.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> projects you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
