    "# How do I _copy_ an app from one of my other _projects_?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Apps include both tools (individual bioinformatics utilities) and workflows (chains or pipelines of connected tools). Apps are located in one of two places: the [Seven Bridges Public Apps repository](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/public/apps) or a user-created project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You can copy an app from the Public App repository or from a project of which you're a member. Here, we focus on **copying an app from another project**. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. We'll define the project and app IDs\n",
    "2. We'll copy an app to the destination project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of at least two projects, one with the app that should be copied and another one where the app needs to be copied to. Learn more about creating a new project. [[recipe](projects_makeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)].\n",
    " 2. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 3. You have at least one app in one project. If not, you can copy one from the Public Apps repository. [[recipe](apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    " 4. You can find app and project ID. We can find entity IDs via API or on the platform visual interface. [[reference](https://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api#identifying-projects-users-apps-files-tasks-and-inputs)]\n",
    " 5. You understand how to list apps within a project. We will use this call below and find the copied app. [[recipe](apps_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb)\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "We import the `Api` class from the official `sevenbridges-python` bindings below.  \n",
    "We also import the `Conflict` error to handle situations when trying to copy over an existing app."

    "To make these results very obvious, use an empty project as your my\\_project (e.g. your <a href=projects_makeNew.ipynb> cookbook example project</a>) or add the _name_ arguement to something ridiculous like 'Orange Mocha Frapachino Maker'. In this example, we will handle these situations with a predefined error `Conflict` for this situation.\n",
