    "### Overview\n",
    "Billing information on the Seven Bridges platforms is broken down to three categories:\n",
    "- Analysis\n",
    "- Storage\n",
    "- Egress\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on how all the costs are calculated, please refer to the Seven Bridges documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recipe will show how to:\n",
    "- Select a billing group\n",
    "- Get analysis costs breakdown for a time period and total analysis costs\n",
    "- Get storage costs breakdown for a time period and total storage costs\n",
    "- Get egress costs breakdown for a time period and total egress costs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be an admin of _at least one_ billing group.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
