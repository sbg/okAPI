    "There are a number of API calls related to projects. Here we focus on listing projects. As with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each project. There are two versions of this call:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. (default) **paginated** call that will return 50 projects\n",
    " 2. **all-records** call that will page through and return all projects \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of _at least one_ project.\n",
    " 2. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
