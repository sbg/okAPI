    "# Which _apps_ are in my project?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "You can lists all apps available to you on the Platform. By default, all of the apps within your project(s) are returned to you. You can also choose to only list the apps within a specific project. Conversely, you can set the parameter `visibility=public` to list all apps available to you from the Seven Bridges' [Public Apps repository](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/public-apps) of tools and workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, as with any **list**-type call, we will get minimal information about each app. There are two versions of this call:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. (default) A **paginated** call that will return 50 apps.\n",
    " 2. An **all-records** call that will page through and return all apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Here we focus on **listing all apps within one project**. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "1. We'll list all our projects.\n",
    "2. Then, we'll list the apps within the first project on the list generated above.\n",
    "3. Lastly, we'll list all apps within any of our projects by not specifying a project ID in our request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need to be a member (or owner) of at least one project. Learn more about creating a new project. [[recipe](projects_makeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)].\n",
    " 2. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 3. You understand how to list projects of which you are a member. We will use this call directly to select a project below. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    " 4. You have at least one app in your selected project. If not, you can copy one from the Public Apps repository. [[recipe](apps_copyFromPublicApps.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/copy-an-app)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb).\n",
