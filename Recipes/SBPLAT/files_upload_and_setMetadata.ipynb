    "### Overview\n",
    "Do you like files but are tired of copying Public Reference files, using the FTP uploader, using the Command Line Updloader, or using the GUI Uploader? _Well now there's a **better way**!_ Here we introduce file upload via API. Specifically we will:\n",

    " 1. create a new project\n",
    " 2. check that there are no files\n",
    " 3. upload some files\n",
    " 4. set any metadata we like\n",
    " 5. search for the files via metadata\n",
    " \n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 3. You downloaded/cloned the whole repo so the files we will try to upload exist\n",
