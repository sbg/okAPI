    "# How do I create an _app_ from a CWL JSON?\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "You can upload any app to the Platform using its raw [Common Workflow Language](http://www.commonwl.org/) description written in JSON. This recipe is actually an _edge-case_ but is one that the author uses frequently. It would also be a good fit if you are using code from a github repo, e.g. [Gaurav Kaushik's](https://github.com/gaurav-kaushik/py2cwl) excellent ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "We'll **upload an app** to a project from its raw CWL. [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/add-an-app-using-raw-cwl)]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. We'll start by creating a new project.\n",
    " 2. Next, we'll check that there are no apps in our new project.\n",
    " 3. Then, we'll upload our app using raw CWL.\n",
    " 4. Lastly, we'll check that our new exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your **authentication token** and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">Setup_API_environment.ipynb</a> for details. Learn more about [obtaining your authentication token](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/v1.0/docs/get-your-authentication-token).\n",
    " 2. You have a **properly formatted** CWL description in a JSON file <sup>1</sup>.\n",
    " 3. You understand how to list projects of which you are a member. We will use this call to check that the new project we will create does not already exist. [[recipe](projects_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-your-projects)]\n",
    " 4. You undersand how to create a new project [[recipe](projects_MakeNew.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/create-a-new-project)]\n",
    " 4. You understand how to list apps in your project. We will first use this to check there are no apps in your project. Then, we will use this request again later to check you have successfully uploaded your new app to your project. [[recipe](apps_listAll.ipynb)] [[reference](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/list-all-apps-available-to-you)]\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that as with all okAPI recipes, this recipe makes use of the [Seven Bridges Public API Python library](../Tutorials/SBPLAT/Setup_API_environment.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> **Note:** Due to slight inconsistencies in how the OS handles formatting, you might improperly copy the JSON if you manually **select**, **copy**, and **paste** code into a text editor before _saving_ it as a JSON. Instead, try to either download a properly formatted JSON or use the **Export** button on the desired app on the Seven Bridges Platform before saving the resulting webpage as a JSON directly. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "We import the `Api` class from the official `sevenbridges-python` bindings below."
