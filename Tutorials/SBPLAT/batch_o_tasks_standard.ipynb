    "We are going to _start from scratch_ in this tutorial. Specifically, we will:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Create a project\n",
    " 2. (optional) Add members\n",
    " 3. Copy WGS bam files from Public [CCLE project](https://igor.sbgenomics.com/u/sevenbridges/cancer-cell-line-encyclopedia-ccle/)\n",
    " 4. Upload the workflow _CNVnator Analysis_ from a version modified in Public Apps\n",
    " 5. Create a batch task\n",
    " 6. Check for errors\n",
    " 7. Spin it up\n",

    "Throughout this **tutorial**, we will link back to different **recipes** in case you need more detail about the calls. We will also link to the **documentation** for each call. Both links will be under the **PROTIPS** section heading at the end of the markdown section.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 2. You have cloned the Public Project _Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)_. We will walk through that in the markdown of Step 3.\n",
