    "# Rough draft of getting _vcf_ files\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Different tertiary analysis software often works with _vcf_ or _gene expression_ files. Depending on the API they use, you may want to _point to the actual file_ **or** accept _an http download link_. We are going to show both approaches here, but adding a download step is trivial<sup>1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two** approaches we will show to get **vcf download links**. This may be something you would like to do locally or as a _push-button_ from within a tertiary analysis GUI.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Specify a **project** and grab **all** vcf files within that project (a.k.a. the _lazy way_)\n",
    " * Specify both a **task** and **project** and look for _outputs_ of that task which are vcf format.\n",
    " \n",
    "Obvious extensions would be to keep track of previously imported file names, or only take tasks more recent than a certain date. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    " 1. You need your _authentication token_ and the API needs to know about it. See <a href=\"Setup_API_environment.ipynb\">**Setup_API_environment.ipynb**</a> for details.\n",
    " 2. You understand how to <a href=\"../../Recipes/SBPLAT/projects_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> **projects** you are a member of (we will just use that call directly and pick one here).\n",
    " 3. You understand how to <a href=\"../../Recipes/SBPLAT/files_listAll.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> **files** within one of your projects.\n",
    " 4. You understand how to <a href=\"../../Recipes/SBPLAT/tasks_monitorAndGetResults.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">deal with</a> **tasks** within one of your projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> the **.download()** method for a _file object_ will do this directly. You are welcome to use your favorite flavor of downloader.\n",
