# ok, API
To help people maximize the _extensibility_ and _automation_ capability of our products, we're happy to share example **API** code. These examples have been used to address common user _wants_ and _needs_. They are divided into **recipes** & **tutorials**. 

* **_"How do I do this one thing?"_** You want a **recipe**, which is a _modular_ example of common operations. 
* **_"How do I complete my entire analysis?"_** You want a **tutorial**, which may _combine multiple recipes_ to go from start to finish of an analysis. 

The _recipe_ and _tutorial_ folders are subdivided into **CGC** (Cancer Genomics Cloud) and **SBPLAT** (Seven Bridges Platform). Each folder has it's own _readme_ files within each folder which details the scripts. Feedback and improvements are welcome. Good luck & have fun!

### Notes
1. This is compatible with **Python 2.7 only**. We are working towards version 3 compatiblity but need to adapt a few libraries.
2. This is an **beta** and we are constantly working on improving our API and wrapper. Expect the awesomeness to continue.
3. Please share your _feedback_ on our [CGC forum](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/discuss) or [SBG forum](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/discuss).
4. We are happy to recieve Pull Requests with your _improvements_.
5. While there is a lot of overlap between these systems, there are some CGC-specific documentation and metadata fields that are not present on the Platform and vice versa
